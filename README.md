### License  

This library is covered by th LGPL v3.0 license  
Read the license provided here: [License](/LICENSE)  
Check the official GNU site here: [www.gnu.org/](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html)  

This is essentially the GNU GPLv3.0 license, except for allowing the use of this library in projects otherwise covered by other licenses.  
I have chosen this because this library brings nothing new to the table, its just convenient and impressive, and GPL licensed works cant be used by most other projects.  
For maximum interoperability, at the cost of being usable in proprietary works, the LGPL allows for multiple licenses covering just sections of your project.
