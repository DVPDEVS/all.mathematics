### License  

This library is covered by the GNU LGPL v3.0 license    
Read the provided license here: [License](/LICENSE)  
Check the official GNU site here: [www.gnu.org/](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html)  

GNU LGPL v3.0 is patent-protective and copyleft, covering the developers and contributors from being sued by terminating protections for users should they try to sue.  
The copyleft is what enforces the library to remain under LGPL 3.0, but is weak in the sense that it does not enforce itself onto any works using the library.  
This means you can use this for a project covered by, say, Apache 2.0, MIT, CC0, etc. so long as the license is not strongly copyleft, and you keep the library license the same etc.
